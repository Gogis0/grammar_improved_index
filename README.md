# Improved Grammar Index

This project is the implementation of a grammar-based index proposed in [1]. 
This index uses O(G lg n) bits and can find the occ occurrences of patterns P[1..m] in time O((m2 + occ)lg G).
We implement the index and demonstrate its practicality compared to the state of the art, in highly repetitive text collections.

## Compilation ðŸš€
First download the project

```
git clone https://github.com/apachecom/grammar_improved_index.git
```

In order to compile the program, it is necessary to download, compile and install the Succinct Data Structure Library (SDSL).

```
git clone https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite
cd sdsl-lite
./install-sh <path to gidx repository>
```

In order to run benchmark you will need some external libraries as gflags (https://github.com/gflags/gflags.git) and libcds (https://github.com/fclaude/libcds.git)


Now, it is posible to compile the binaries
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
make 
```

In order to test the algorithm, you can use the collections located in the repository http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/repcorpus.html
```
wget  http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/repcorpus/real/einstein.en.txt.gz
gunzip einstein.en.txt.gz
```
We suggest processing collections in order to remove forbidden characters.
```
./process_coll <input_file> <output_file>
```
## Build the index 

To build the index, you must run

```
./build_indices <collection_file> <index_out_file> 
```

If you use the option -DUSE_MEM_MONITOR to the compilator you should pass the output file for memory measurement

```
./build_indices <collection_file> <index_out_file> <mem_out_file>
```

Since we use google-benchmark, you can generate CSV files with the results
```
./build_indices <collection_file> <index_out_file> <mem_out_file> --benchmark_out=<results_file> --benchmark_out_format=csv
```

## Display operation

To extract a substring, one must execute:

```
./display_indices <index_file> <positions_file> min_len max_len gap --benchmark_out=<output_result_file>  --benchmark_out_format=csv
```

where:

- "index_file" is the path of the index file without the extension (Note that ./build_indices generates several versions of our index);

- "positions_file" is a file with the positions to extract separated by a line jump;

- "min" is the minimum length to extract;

- "max" is the maximun length to extract;

- "gap" is the gap betwen lenght;

example:

```
./display_indices f1 ptos 10 100 10 --benchmark_out=out.csv  --benchmark_out_format=csv
```
This will perform an experiment which we will measure the extraction procedure for lengths (10,20,30,...,100)



## Locate operation

To locate a pattern, one must execute:
```
./locate_indices <index_file> <pattern_file> min_len max_len gap --benchmark_out=<output_result_file>  --benchmark_out_format=csv
```

where:

- "positions_file" is a file with the patterns to locate NOT separated by a line jump; The patterns must have length = max_len

The rest of the parameters are the same as for the extraction
